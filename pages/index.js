                                <p className="text-sm md:text-lg font-seven mb-4 px-2">SAT stands for Social Appreciation Tokens, a revolutionary tokenization system on the Tezos network that transforms the relationship between artists and their supporters. SATs operate on the principle of decentralized promotion and ownership, creating a symbiotic ecosystem that benefits both artists and token holders.</p>

                            <AccordionItem title={`How are SATs different from Friend.tech on Ethereum ?`}>
                                <p className="text-sm md:text-lg font-seven mb-4 px-2">SATs distinguish themselves by offering a unique approach to supporting artists in the digital age. Unlike Friend.tech on Ethereum, SATs leverage the Tezos blockchain, allowing users to acquire shares of their favorite artists directly. The decentralized promotion by token holders across social media platforms forms the core of SATs, creating a dynamic and mutually beneficial relationship.</p>

                            <AccordionItem title="How do SATs work in promoting artists ?">
                                <p className="text-sm md:text-lg font-seven mb-4 px-2">SATs operate on the principle of continuous promotion by token holders across various social media channels. This decentralized approach leverages the collective power of the community, enabling artists to tap into new audiences and gain exposure. Token holders become stakeholders in the success of the artist, contributing to a decentralized ecosystem of artistic appreciation.</p>

                            <AccordionItem title="What role does SAT play in decentralized finance (DeFi) ?">
                                <p className="text-sm md:text-lg font-seven mb-4 px-2">SATs integrate seamlessly with the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape by offering art in exchange for tokens. This adds an additional layer of utility to SATs, allowing token holders to explore new avenues for leveraging their assets. The integration of SATs into DeFi not only diversifies their utility but also establishes a tangible connection between artistic output and the financial aspects of decentralized finance.</p>

                            <AccordionItem title="What is admin control for FA2 token ?">
                                <p className="text-sm md:text-lg font-seven mb-4 px-2">Admin control allows the token administrator to perform various functions, including updating admin details, pausing transfers, token approvals, as well as creating, minting, and burning tokens. For increased flexibility, the Granular version enables the pausing/unpausing of assets separately.</p>

                            <AccordionItem title="What are token decimals in the context of FA2 tokens ?">
                                <p className="text-sm md:text-lg font-seven mb-4 px-2">Token decimals refer to the unit used for displaying the token amount to users. It determines the maximum number of places after the dot in the token's amount representation. For instance, if SATs have 2 decimals, the smallest amount that can be represented is 0.01 SATs.</p>

                            <AccordionItem title="How can I link an image with a URL for my FA2 token ?">
                                <p className="text-sm md:text-lg font-seven mb-4 px-2">To link an image with a URL, consider uploading the image to a storage service or IPFS. Once uploaded, use the URL of the image when updating the token contract information. This ensures that the image associated with your FA2 token is accessible and visible.</p>
