                <AccordionItem title="What is SAT (Social Appreciation Tokens) on Tezos ?">
                    <p className="text-sm md:text-lg font-monocode my-4 px-2">SAT stands for Social Appreciation Tokens, a revolutionary tokenization system on the Tezos network that transforms the relationship between artists and their supporters. SATs operate on the principle of decentralized promotion and ownership, creating a symbiotic ecosystem that benefits both artists and token holders.</p>

                <AccordionItem title={`How are SATs different from Friend.tech on Ethereum ?`}>
                    <p className="text-sm md:text-lg font-monocode my-4 px-2">SATs distinguish themselves by offering a unique approach to supporting artists in the digital age. Unlike Friend.tech on Ethereum, SATs leverage the Tezos blockchain, allowing users to acquire shares of their favorite artists directly. The decentralized promotion by token holders across social media platforms forms the core of SATs, creating a dynamic and mutually beneficial relationship.</p>

                    <p className="text-sm md:text-lg font-monocode my-4 px-2">SATs integrate seamlessly with the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape by offering art in exchange for tokens. This adds an additional layer of utility to SATs, allowing token holders to explore new avenues for leveraging their assets. The integration of SATs into DeFi not only diversifies their utility but also establishes a tangible connection between artistic output and the financial aspects of decentralized finance.</p>
